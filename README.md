# SQLAlchemy Challenge

Included in this repo is a "SurfsUp" folder that contains a "Resources" folder along with a Jupyter Notebook, and a Python file that uses SQLAlchemy and Flask to create an SQLite databse in order to perform climate analysis on Hawaii given the included CSV files. Ultimately, the final product creates a Flask API with endpoints that point to the results of the analysis.
